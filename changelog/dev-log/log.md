# Notes

## 02/02/22 - 03/02/22

Decided on a restructure. Struggling to find the way to structure files.
Decided on a routes folder for modularised routes using express' router.
Clarified the client and server seperation.
Added a data folder to mimic a database whilst testing.
Think I have somewhere to make a good start now.

Realised that I may have made the HTML and design way too complex - going to tone things down in order to focus on functionality.
